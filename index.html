    <h1><span class="emoji">🎙️</span> Operation: Mood Rescue <span class="emoji">💖</span></h1>
    <p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen,</strong> we interrupt your scheduled sadness with an emergency broadcast from the Ministry of Love and Absolute Goofiness…</p>
    <p>This is your boyfriend speaking — certified Hug Dealer, Minister of Sarcasm, and the only human who believes you’re a superhero in disguise (but like, with cuter pajamas).</p>
    <p>Now I’ve been informed by highly trusted sources — aka your face on video call and a suspicious lack of emojis — that you are feeling a bit meh today. And that, my love, is UNACCEPTABLE behavior. Because you’re not just any girl… you’re <strong>MY</strong> girl.</p>
    <p>And my girl doesn’t stay sad for long because I will literally dance like a jellybean in a microwave if that’s what it takes to make you smile.</p>
    <p>In fact, I’ve consulted with the International Board of Love Experts (it’s just me wearing a lab coat and eating ice cream), and we’ve come to this conclusion: You, yes YOU, are officially too beautiful, too smart, and too much of a badass to let a bad day win.</p>
    <p><em>(Also, I suspect the sadness might be because you haven’t said ‘I love you’ to me in, like, 27 minutes. Coincidence? I think not.)</em></p>
    <p>So here’s what we’re going to do: close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine me hugging you so tightly that even your worries go, ‘Okay bro, we out.’</p>
    <p>Then you’ll open your eyes and send me a selfie — bonus points if you’re smiling or doing that cute ‘stop taking my photo’ pout that you secretly know I love.</p>
    <p>Remember this — you’re not alone. I’m just a message, a call, or a teleportation spell away (still working on that one). And if all else fails, I’m sending you a meme so ridiculous, your sadness will run away just to escape the cringe.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>“Jab tak hai jaan, jab tak hai smile, main tumhara clown ban’ke rahunga.”</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #d93f87;">Now smile. Because your happiness is my favorite thing in the whole world. 💕</p>
